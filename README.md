## üöÄ Features

* **Background AI Queue (WP‚ÄëCron):** Unattended OpenAI generation at scale with a custom queue table, minutely worker, concurrency lock, and bulk enqueue action. Works on shared hosting via real cron (SiteGround/cPanel guides included).
* **In‚ÄëAdmin Guides:** Embedded ‚ÄúHow to Use‚Äù for AI and background queue, plus an in‚Äëadmin REST API quick reference for maintainers.
* **Admin Queue Indicator:** Live top‚Äëcenter status in WP Admin while the queue is active (Processing/Waiting + counts) with Pause/Resume, Stop‚Äëafter‚Äëcurrent, and Cancel queued controls. Updates every 20s; disable via filter.
* **CSV Import (Admin):** Upload a CSV to create posts with car details. Title becomes `Year Make Model`; Make is assigned as Category (created if missing). Supports using the bundled `cars.csv` sample or your own file. Imported Makes automatically appear in the admin Make dropdown.
* **AI-Powered Content Generation:** OpenAI integration for auto-generating post titles, content, and SEO fields based on car details. Supports both single-post and bulk operations.
* **SEO Meta Module (conflict‚Äësafe):** Per‚Äëpost SEO Title, Description, Keywords, and No‚Äëindex with automatic conflict detection for Yoast/Rank Math. Filter‚Äëcontrolled output and post‚Äëtype targeting.
* **Car Details, Done Right:** Grid cards show Year, Make, Model, Trim, Price, Mileage, Engine, Transmission ‚Äî clearly labeled, formatted, and auto‚Äëhidden when all values are empty.
* **Lightning‚ÄëFast Search & Autosuggest:** Whole‚Äëword matching, fast queries, and smart category filtering with instant UI updates.
* **Grid/List Views + Sorting:** Sort by title, category, rating, comments, and date. Pagination and totals always reflect applied filters.
* **Compare up to 4 Cars:** Dedicated, responsive compare page with easy selection and a floating compare bar.
* **Compare details, side‚Äëby‚Äëside:** Year, Make, Model, Trim, Price, Mileage, Engine, Transmission (mileage unit localized).
* **User Ratings:** 1‚Äì5 star ratings per post with average and vote counts displayed in results.
* **Admin Productivity:** Dropdowns for Year, Make, Transmission ensure consistent data entry. The Make dropdown auto‚Äëexpands with any distinct `ucs_make` values found in existing posts and remains alphabetically sorted.
* **Dynamic Make Dropdown (New):** Automatically includes any newly imported or manually entered Makes from existing posts, deduplicated and alphabetically sorted for consistent data entry.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Pure ES6 + Fetch API. No jQuery or heavy frameworks.
* **Scalable & Clean:** Namespaced assets, selective loading, and REST endpoints designed for large datasets.
* **Extensible:** Carefully designed hooks/filters and modular PHP includes for safe customization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

1. Upload the plugin folder to `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate **Used Cars Search** in WP Admin.
3. Add `[used_cars_search]` to any post or page.
4. To enable the compare feature, create a new page (e.g., named "Compare"), add the `[ucs_compare_page]` shortcode to it, and then select this page from the dropdown in the plugin's settings page (**Used Cars Search -> Settings**).

---

## CSV Import (Admin)

Use the in-admin importer to seed posts from a CSV. Each row creates/updates a post with car details saved to meta.

### Where
* Go to: `Used Cars Search ‚Üí CSV Import`.

### CSV format
* Required columns: `Year, Make, Model`
* Optional columns: `Trim, Mileage, Engine, Transmission, Price`
* A sample file is included at: `cars.csv` in the plugin folder.

### Mapping
* Post title: `Year Make Model` (e.g., `2020 Ford Mustang`)
* Post content: empty (ready for AI generation later)
* Category: `Make` value (created if missing, selected if exists)
* Meta keys:
  * `ucs_year` (int)
  * `ucs_make` (string)
  * `ucs_model` (string)
  * `ucs_trim` (string)
  * `ucs_mileage` (int)
  * `ucs_engine` (string)
  * `ucs_transmission` (string)
  * `ucs_price` (float)

### Behavior
* If a post with the same title already exists, the importer updates its category/meta instead of creating a new post.
* Choose post status (Draft or Publish) for created posts.
* Mileage and Price are sanitized to numbers; other fields are stored as text.
* Admin Make dropdown auto‚Äëincludes newly imported Makes for easy editing later.



## üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced Admin Dashboard (v1.4.1)

* The admin dashboard/settings page is included as part of this plugin.
* Now features a statistics widget showing:
  * Published Posts
  * Total Star Ratings
  * Average Star Rating
  * Approved Comments
* Improved admin UX, with settings, compare page selection, and a "Danger Zone" for quick data resets.
* The dashboard provides settings, stats, and management tools designed for Used Cars Search.

## üîç SEO Meta (v1.5.0)

* __Fields__: SEO Title, SEO Description, SEO Keywords, No-index toggle.
* __Meta Box__: Shown on `post` by default. Extendable via `ucs_seo_post_types` filter.
* **Output behavior**
  * If no popular SEO plugin is detected, this plugin outputs:
    * `<title>` override (when SEO Title is set)
    * `<meta name="description">`
    * `<meta name="keywords">` (legacy/optional)
    * `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow">` when No-index is checked
  * If Yoast SEO or Rank Math is active, output is disabled by default to avoid duplicate tags.
* **Enable/disable output**

```php
// Force-enable or disable this plugin's SEO output
add_filter('ucs_seo_enable_output', function($enabled) {
    return true; // or false
});
```

* **Target other post types**

```php
// Show the SEO meta box on additional post types
add_filter('ucs_seo_post_types', function($types) {
    $types[] = 'page';
    $types[] = 'product';
    return $types;
});
```

> Best practice: If you already use a full SEO suite (Yoast, Rank Math), keep this plugin's SEO output disabled (default) and use it only if you need lightweight, per-post overrides.

## üîå REST API: Car Details & SEO (v1.5.2)

* __Exposed Meta__: All car details (`ucs_year`, `ucs_make`, `ucs_model`, `ucs_trim`, `ucs_price`, `ucs_mileage`, `ucs_engine`, `ucs_transmission`) and SEO fields (`_ucs_seo_title`, `_ucs_seo_description`, `_ucs_seo_keywords`, `_ucs_seo_noindex`) are registered with `show_in_rest`.
* __Endpoint__: Core WP posts API: `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`.
* __Auth__: Use an admin/editor account via Application Passwords (recommended for Postman/Make.com) or cookie auth.

### Read (GET)

> Note: Requires your own OpenAI API key. The plugin includes a test connection feature to verify your API key works before enabling AI features.

### HTML‚Äëonly structured output (v1.6.6)

* **Unified generation path**: Manual Generate, Bulk Generate & Apply, and the background queue all use the same core generator for consistent results.
* **Strict HTML layout** (no Markdown):
  * Optional first line: `<h2><a href="{homepage_url}">{Dynamic Sub‚Äëheadline}</a></h2>` when enabled in settings
  * Intro paragraph
  * `<h2>` sections: Vehicle Overview, Why It Stands Out, Who It Is For, Performance & Efficiency, Ownership & Reliability
  * `<h3>` Frequently Asked Questions with a `<ul>` containing 4‚Äì5 Q&A list items
  * `<h3>` Summary with a closing paragraph
  * Ends with 6‚Äì12 hashtag lines (each starts with `#`), no labels or counts
* **Dynamic sub‚Äëheadline (optional)**:
  * Toggle in AI Settings: ‚ÄúEnable Dynamic Sub‚Äëheadline‚Äù
  * Configurable ‚ÄúHomepage URL‚Äù used for the link target

* **What‚Äôs shown:** Year, Make, Model, Trim, Price, Mileage, Engine, Transmission for each compared post.
* **Formatting:** Localized thousands separators for Price and Mileage.
* **Localization:** The ‚Äúmiles‚Äù unit label is translated via the plugin text domain.

## üîÑ Unattended Background Queue (WP‚ÄëCron)

Run large AI generations while logged out or overnight. The plugin ships a custom queue table, a minutely worker, and a concurrency lock to process items in small batches safely.

### How to use
1. Enable AI and save in `Used Cars Search ‚Üí AI Settings`.
2. Enqueue posts: Posts list ‚Üí select posts ‚Üí Bulk actions ‚Üí "AI Assist: Queue for Background" ‚Üí Apply.
3. Let WP‚ÄëCron process items automatically in the background.

#### Scheduling behavior (v1.6.7)
* When the worker applies AI content to posts with status `draft`, `pending`, or `auto-draft`, they are automatically scheduled 24 hours ahead (status `future`).
* Schedules use the site timezone via `current_time()` and set `post_date_gmt` accordingly.

### Admin status indicator
* A live top‚Äëcenter indicator appears in WP Admin while the queue is running or items are queued.
* It shows Processing‚Ä¶/Waiting/Paused with counts and updates every 20 seconds.
* Controls:
  * Pause/Resume: toggles queue processing on the next cron tick (items remain queued)
  * Stop: finishes the current item then stops the current run (soft stop)
  * Cancel queued: marks all queued items as canceled (processing item is not interrupted)
* Notes:
  * ‚ÄúPause‚Äù prevents new work from starting; resume to continue.
  * ‚ÄúStop‚Äù cannot kill an active HTTP request in WordPress; it safely stops after the current item.
  * Canceled items stay recorded with status `canceled` and are excluded from processing.
* To disable the indicator globally:

```php
add_filter('ucs_ai_queue_indicator_enabled', '__return_false');
```

### Local (Laragon)
* Windows Task Scheduler: call `http://localhost/popular-ai-software-search/wp-cron.php` every minute.
* Alternative: add `define('ALTERNATE_WP_CRON', true);` in `wp-config.php` and ensure periodic traffic.

### SiteGround (shared hosting)
1. In `wp-config.php` add: `define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);`
2. Site Tools ‚Üí Devs ‚Üí Cron Jobs ‚Üí Create Cron Job
   * Schedule: every 1 minute (or the smallest allowed, e.g. 5 minutes)
   * Command (choose one):
     * `wget -q -O - https://your-domain.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron > /dev/null 2>&1`
     * `curl -s https://your-domain.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron > /dev/null 2>&1`
3. Keep `?doing_wp_cron` to bypass cache layers; replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain.

### cPanel (generic shared hosting)
* Cron Jobs ‚Üí Add New Cron Job
* Use the same `wget` or `curl` command above and the smallest interval allowed.

Tips: Batch size is modest by default and can be filtered via `ucs_ai_queue_batch_size`. If your host doesn‚Äôt allow 1‚Äëminute crons, use 5 minutes‚Äîthe queue resumes each tick.

## üß™ Testing

### Test Plan

#### 1. Keyword Search (Speed and Accuracy)
- Search for `crayo` - Should return "Crayon" results quickly
- Search for `art` - Should only match whole words (not "article" or "chart")

#### 2. Category Filtering
- Select a category (e.g., "Advertising") - Should show all posts in that category
- Search for a term within a selected category - Should only show matching posts from that category

#### 3. Sorting Options
- Test all sort orders with various searches:
  - Newest (default)
  - Title A-Z
  - Title Z-A
  - Most Comments

#### 4. Pagination
- Navigate through multiple pages of results
- Verify page numbers and navigation controls update correctly

#### 5. Autosuggest
- Type slowly in the search box - Should show relevant keyword suggestions
- Clicking a suggestion should perform the search

#### 6. Compare Feature
- Click "Add to Compare" on a few search results. The compare bar should appear at the bottom.
- The selected items should appear in the compare bar.
- Click the "x" on an item in the bar to remove it.
- Click the "Compare (N)" button. It should redirect to the configured compare page.
- The compare page should display the selected items in a two-column grid.
- Test responsiveness: on a small screen, the compare bar should stack vertically, and the compare page grid should become a single column.

#### 7. Edge Cases
- Search for special characters
- Test with very long search terms
- Try searching with no keywords (should return all posts)
