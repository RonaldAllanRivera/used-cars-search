## üß™ Testing

### Test Plan

#### 1. Keyword Search (Speed and Accuracy)
- Search for `crayo` - Should return "Crayon" results quickly
- Search for `art` - Should only match whole words (not "article" or "chart")

#### 2. Category Filtering
- Select a category (e.g., "Advertising") - Should show all posts in that category
- Search for a term within a selected category - Should only show matching posts from that category

#### 3. Sorting Options
- Test all sort orders with various searches:
  - Newest (default)
  - Title A-Z
  - Title Z-A
  - Most Comments

#### 4. Pagination
- Navigate through multiple pages of results
- Verify page numbers and navigation controls update correctly

#### 5. Autosuggest
- Type slowly in the search box - Should show relevant keyword suggestions
- Clicking a suggestion should perform the search

#### 6. Compare Feature
- Click "Add to Compare" on a few search results. The compare bar should appear at the bottom.
- The selected items should appear in the compare bar.
- Click the "x" on an item in the bar to remove it.
- Click the "Compare (N)" button. It should redirect to the configured compare page.
- The compare page should display the selected items in a two-column grid.
- Test responsiveness: on a small screen, the compare bar should stack vertically, and the compare page grid should become a single column.

#### 7. Edge Cases
- Search for special characters
- Test with very long search terms
- Try searching with no keywords (should return all posts)
